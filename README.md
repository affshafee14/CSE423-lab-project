# ⚽ Interactive Football Game with OpenGL 🎮

## 📝 Description
This project is an advanced interactive football game simulation built using **OpenGL** and **Pygame**. It provides an immersive gaming experience by allowing players to move, interact with a ball, and score goals. The game integrates features such as player lives, collision detection, and dynamic field rendering. It uses the **Midpoint Circle Algorithm (MPC)** and **Midpoint Line Algorithm (MPL)** for graphics rendering.

### Features:
- 🌍 **Interactive Football Field**: A complete football field with penalty areas and a center circle.
- 🔵 **Ball Movement and Physics**: Realistic ball interactions, including wall collisions and direction updates.
- 🏃 **Dynamic Player Control**: Two players can move across the field, controlled via separate keybindings.
- ❤️ **Player Lives**: Each player starts with 3 lives, visualized as hearts on the screen.
- 🥅 **Goal Scoring System**: Players score by directing the ball into the opposing goal.
- 🎨 **Field Color Customization**: Switch between different field colors using keyboard shortcuts.
- ✋ **Game Controls**: Pause, retry, and exit options are accessible via mouse clicks.
- 🔢 **Scoring and Win Conditions**: Players win by scoring 3 goals.

### Technologies Used:
- 🖥️ **OpenGL**: For rendering graphics and objects.
- 🎮 **Pygame**: For handling input and displaying OpenGL content.
- 🐍 **Python**: The core language for game logic and implementation.

## 🎮 How to Play:

1. **Start the Game**: Run the script to launch the game.
2. **Control Players**:
   - **Player 1**: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to move.
   - **Player 2**: Use `I`, `J`, `K`, `L` keys to move.
3. **Score Goals**: Push the ball into the opposing goal to score.
4. **Track Lives**: Players lose a life if the opponent scores; the game ends when a player's lives reach zero.
5. **Pause and Retry**:
   - Pause or resume the game using the pause button.
   - Reset the game using the retry button.
6. **Change Field Color**: Press `1` (Green), `2` (Blue), `3` (Red), or `4` (Default Light Blue).
