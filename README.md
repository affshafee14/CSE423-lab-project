# ⚽ Interactive Football Game with OpenGL 🎮

## 📝 Description
This project is an interactive football game simulation built using **OpenGL** and **Pygame**. The game allows players to move freely around the field and interact with a ball. The game utilizes the **Midpoint Circle Algorithm (MPC)** and **Midpoint Line Algorithm (MPL)** to render circles (for the ball and players) and lines (for the field and goals) using only `GL_POINTS` in OpenGL.

### Features:
- 🌍 **Interactive Field**: Players can move freely across the entire football field.
- 🔵 **Circle Rendering**: The ball and players are rendered as circles using the Midpoint Circle Algorithm.
- 🏃 **Dynamic Player Movement**: Players can be selected and dragged around the field using the mouse.

### Technologies Used:
- 🖥️ **OpenGL**: For rendering graphics and objects.
- 🎮 **Pygame**: For handling input and displaying the OpenGL content.
- 🐍 **Python**: The primary language for the game's logic and interactions.

## 🎮 How to Play:

1. **Start the Game**: Run the Python script to start the simulation.
2. **Move the Players**: Click and hold on either player (red or blue) to drag them around the field.
3. **Watch the Action**: Observe how the players move and interact with the ball.

## 🚀 To-Do (Future Enhancements):

- ⚽ **Goal Scoring System**: Implement a goal-scoring system to track player scores.
- 🦶 **Player Interactions**: Add the ability for players to kick the ball.
- 🌐 **Ball Physics**: Add realistic ball movement and collisions.
- 👥 **Team Selection**: Allow users to select teams and customize players.
- 🖥️ **Game Interface**: Develop a UI to display score, timer, and game settings.
